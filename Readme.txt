Simple tool to split (PSP) GIM files that contain multiple Picture blocks, into multiple GIM files with single Picture blocks.

This exists because the GIM viewers I could find like Noesis and that Chinese/Japanese one, only display the first picture block and I wanted to look at the others.

As mentioned this currently only works on little endian GIM files (the ones that start MIG.00.1PSP ) so not PS3 ones
